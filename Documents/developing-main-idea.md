# Winning Idea: Developing Concept

+ <u>**WINNING IDEA**</u>: platformer set inside a tiny person's very large house and surroundings. The goal of the platformer is to leave the big house to go see the little guy's love interest. Along the way, the player can collect little flowers to give to the love interest before leaving the house, but the love interest will be happy regardless to see their partner. This little guy will have to fight many obstacles along the way and avoid things in the house that could hurt him, such as his larger roommate's feet (who may or may not know he lives with them), bugs, rodents, and controller drift breaking the fourth wall a little. The final boss will be a cat that will swipe and claw at the player, preventing him from meeting his love. But fear not! Once the cat is defeated, it will be easy to meet his love interest outside the house, who is ready for their date :) 

 for our main character, we have a little guy :) 

 his goal is to meet another tiny person who is his lover, because they are in love!! they have a date today, and his quest is to make it outside safely to meet his partner.

 they were always tiny, bros just a tiny guy in a big world. he is about 3-4 inches tall, and very small in comparison to the house ~~the normal sized humans are blissfully unaware~~ he lives in

 this will be in a pixelated art style, and a 2d platformer, where our hero uses his push-pin sword to fight enemies in his endeavors to be on time for his date.
