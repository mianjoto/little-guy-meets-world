# Theme: Drifting

+ HIGH CONTENDER (most fun): platformer where the character has to fight controller drift or smth and make it funny?? maybe some funny character lines poking at joycon drift too

+ HIGH CONTENDER (easiest): you’re playing as a leaf fighting against drifting water, avoiding obstacles in a stream of some kind to reach a goal

+ sea survival game on a drifting boat??

+ someone drifting off to sleep and fighting sleep paralysis demons on the way, or trying to differentiate between reality and sleep stuff*

+ game where ur a “drifter” in maybe a sci-fi/fantasy world and u have to collect certain things in your current area before moving to the next

+ you play as a snowflake and try to avoid being eaten/blown into a snowdrift/etc etc

+ drifting power ups in an actual car game, similar to wii party tank game

 either some sort of platformer, (a)rpg, or racing game possibly, leaving that up to the random generator to decide

 we have a little guy :) 

 his goal is to meet another tiny lover because they are in love!! 

 they were always tiny, bros just a tiny guy in a big world. he is about 3-4 inches tall, and has a very hard time finding shoes :(
